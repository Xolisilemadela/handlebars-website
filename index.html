                    <p>Network architecture refers to how computers are organized in a system and how tasks are
                        allocated
                        between these computers. Two of the most widely used types of network architecture are
                        peer-to-peer
                        and client/server. Client/server architecture is also called 'tiered' because it uses multiple
                        levels.</p>

                A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping
                system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system
                for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.
